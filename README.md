# Leaflet-Only_html-css-js
Turned the leaflet and argis demo to a pure leaflet demo without react and added some features.
Changes markers to match current google map with different types depending on the group.
Added more information to popups - matches with current map (google version)

Whole map exists in a single <div> so can be integrated easily (need to add dependancies in html header)
  - only one .js file needed aswell (css file only for div size and background and title)

Need to add way to get data from firebase as an array of dictionaries.
